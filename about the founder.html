<table><h2> <b> <u><font color=#ffffff> How I thought about the idea of making a gaming company </u> </b> </h2>
<p>As the owner of one of the leading gaming companies in the world I would like to tell you how I thought of founding the company.
It was my fantasy to have a gaming company of my own.I always wanted to be the founder and owner of the best gaming company.I always
knew that there was a way to make a game and a website. It was my father who introduced me to Mindchamps, a coding class where I met
Sakshi ma'am who introduced me to coding which is why I am able to make this website. </p></table>

<table><h2> <b> <u>Why I got into making a gamaing company</u> </b> </h2>
<p> I got into making my own company because once when I had gone to my relative office to meet her there I saw
a man playing a game on his pc. after seeing that I always wanted to make a game which could be played anywhere in the world.
I researched on youtube how to make our own game.They kept saying that if we wanted to make our game you would have to learn
coding and binary language.After thatI told my father that I wanted to learn how to code and wanted to learn something called 
binary language.From that moment onwards my father put in a lot of effort in searching for coding classes for me.</p></table>

<table><h2> <b> <u> Whom I would like to thank for making me this capable </u> </b> </h2>
First of all I would like to thank my father for introducing me to Mindchamps.
Next I would like to thank my mother and my sister for supporting me throught the sessions.
I would also like to thank Sakshi ma'am for teaching me how to code which has made me capable enough to type all of this and make website.
I would also want to thank <b><i>HP</i> </b> for making such a nice laptop which has also helped me technically to  make this website.</table>
