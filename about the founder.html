<table><h2> <b> <u><font color=#ffffff> How I thought about the idea of making a gaming company </u> </b> </h2>
<p>As the owner of one of the leading gaming companies in the world I would like to tell you how I thought of founding the company.
It was my fantasy to have a gaming company of my own.I always wanted to be the founder and owner of the best gaming company.I always
knew that there was a way to make a game and a website. It was my father who introduced me to Mindchamps, a coding class where I met
Sakshi ma'am who introduced me to coding which is why I am able to make this website. </p></table>
